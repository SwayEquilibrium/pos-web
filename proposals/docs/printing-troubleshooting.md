# TSP100 Printing Troubleshooting

## ‚úÖ Success! WebPRNT is Working Perfectly

Your printer response shows:
- `traderSuccess: 'true'` ‚úÖ
- `traderCode: '0'` ‚úÖ (success code)
- `status: 200` ‚úÖ
- `traderStatus: '2F8C000000000000000000060000000000'` ‚úÖ

This means the printer is receiving and processing the print commands correctly!

## üîç Why No Physical Output?

Since WebPRNT is working, the issue is likely:

### 1. **Paper Issues** (Most Common)
- **Wrong paper type**: Ensure you're using thermal paper (not regular paper)
- **Paper orientation**: Thermal side should face DOWN (towards the print head)
- **Paper not feeding**: Check if paper roll is properly inserted
- **Paper empty**: Check if there's actually paper in the roll

### 2. **Print Head Issues**
- **Print head not making contact**: Cover might not be fully closed
- **Print head needs cleaning**: Use a cleaning card or alcohol wipe
- **Print head temperature**: Might be too low (check printer settings)

### 3. **Printer Settings**
- **Print density**: Might be set too low in printer web interface
- **Paper width setting**: Should match your actual paper (58mm or 80mm)
- **Character encoding**: Try different encoding settings

## üõ†Ô∏è Immediate Tests

### Test 1: Manual Paper Feed
1. Hold the FEED button for 3-5 seconds
2. Paper should advance and you should see faint marks or lines
3. If no marks appear, it's a hardware/paper issue

### Test 2: Check Paper Type
1. Look at your paper roll
2. Thermal paper usually has a shiny/coated side
3. The coated side should face DOWN (towards print head)
4. Try scratching the paper with your fingernail - thermal paper will show black marks

### Test 3: Print Head Contact
1. Open printer cover
2. Check if print head is making contact with paper
3. Close cover firmly - should click into place
4. Try printing again

## üå°Ô∏è Printer Web Interface Settings

Visit: http://192.168.8.197

Check these settings:
- **Print Density**: Increase if too light (try 80-100%)
- **Print Speed**: Try slower speed for better quality
- **Paper Type**: Set to match your paper width
- **Character Set**: Try UTF-8 or ASCII
